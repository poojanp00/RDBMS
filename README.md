# RDBMS
This project involves writing a simplified relational database management system, often abbreviated RDBMS. An RDBMS is a collection of tables which each include a collection of rows. Each table has a defined schema which specifies the names and types for each of the columns. Each row represents an entry in the corresponding table.
